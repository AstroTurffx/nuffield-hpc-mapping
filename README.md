# UK HPC Mapping
This project is the result of my [Nuffield Research Placement](https://www.nuffieldresearchplacements.org/) at [EPCC](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/) in Edinburgh. My placement involved creating a resource to help researchers find more information on HPCs (High Performance Computers/Computing) in the UK.

This project is not a python package/library for external use, neither is it a maintained or complete repository for all HPCs in the UK. It is not meant to be well structured/written as this project is a proof of concept made in a short amount of time and limited resources.

## Usage
The front end is a single page static site which uses AJAX to fetch and filter HPCs on the website.

**IMAGE OF THE WEBSITE**

The back-end is hosted by `web/server.py`which uses [Flask]() to serve static files and API endpoints.

---

The `Makefile` is used to create the database and scrape information from [Top500](https://www.top500.org/) and add other information gathered. There are also a series of 'constructing' SQL files in `sql/constructing`. They are run in a certain to insert additional information not gathered from Top500.
The script `scraping/top500.py` uses `requests` and `pyquery` to scrape Top500 and navigate through different pages. Instead of loading the [Sublist generator](https://www.top500.org/statistics/sublist/) web page with `requests`, the page is loaded from a file due to me not wanting to deal with keep-alive connections (could be a future to-do)Â·

This project uses SQLite3 on the back-end as it is a small project.
